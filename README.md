# EnchantmentSeedRefresh  
**ESR for Spigot / Paper 1.21**  

## Usage  
To use the plugin, simply enable it with the command, then place lapis in the enchantment table, followed by an enchantable item. When you reopen the table, a new enchant seed will be generated, giving you fresh enchanting possibilities.  

Enabling and disabling the plugin via commands only affects automatic seed regeneration when both an enchantable item and lapis are present. You can still manually refresh the enchant seed using the refresh command.  

If you are an admin, you can adjust the cooldown for regenerating an enchant seed (default: `1000ms`).  

## Commands  
- **`/esr on`** - Enable the plugin.  
- **`/esr off`** - Disable the plugin.  
- **`/esr refresh`** - Manually refresh your enchantment seed.  
- **`/esr cooldown <time in ms>`** - Set cooldown (Admin only).  
- **`/esr status`** - Show your plugin status and current cooldown.  
- **`/esr ?`** - Show a detailed help page.
